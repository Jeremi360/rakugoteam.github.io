A VN- 2D platformer hybrid about two women, Fang and Jayeon, who connect in a jazz bar and try to reach each other through a series of letters.  
Currently, this demo includes only the first part of the story, and is to be developed into a full fledged game in 2021.
Made part of 2020 Yuri Game Jam, and available to play on Windows at the moment. 

## What's the premise?

Light Letters takes place in a cyberpunk apocalyptic era. Our main protagonist and narrator is Fang Pham,
a bold and outspoken woman of Vietnamese-Chinese descent. She has an affinity for jazz music and poetry, and tends to think a lot and laugh.
She later meets Min Jayeon, an older and eloquent housewife of South Korean descent, who has a thing for writing letters and collecting jazz records. 
Together they face the tests of time and monstrous obstacles as Fang tries to reach Jayeon through a series of left behind letters.
