In the Future, where people canâ€™t find games on Dream the digital distribution store created by Gabe Renewal,
one AI Bot stands to curate for the players and keep his world alive before people go shop somewhere else.
Bot saves dream!

Most of the art was created by Title Pending The,
dialog system has been developed by Jeremi360 
And most of the coding came from Plopsis
