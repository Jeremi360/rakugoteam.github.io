# Godot-Material-Icons

- [repo](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Godot-Material-Icons)
- [download](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Godot-Material-Icons/releases)
- docs (WIP)

[*Templarian's Material-Design-Icons*](https://github.com/templarian/MaterialDesign) 
is a collection of icons for the [Material Design](https://material.io/) specification.

This addon provides the following nodes to use the icons in Godot:
- **MaterialIcon**: A node that displays an icon from the Material Design Icons collection.
- **MaterialButton**: A node that displays an icon from the Material Design Icons collection as a button (without label).

It's also adds **IconsFinder** to the Godot's **Tools** menu.
So you can find the icons easily.
