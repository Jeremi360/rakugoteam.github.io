Inspired by [Ren'Py], Rakugo Project is aimed at providing you a toolset for narrative-based games on [Godot].

Simplify your project, if it is a visual novel, point and click, RPG, interactive text game or many other styles and blends of styles.

We provide you with a set of [plugins](/addons/), that can be used in any Godot project, like a [dialog system](/rakugo-dialogue-system).

They are also [kits](/kits/), that bring together our plugins to a godot project that fit a project genre, like [visual novel](/kits/visual-novel-kit).
