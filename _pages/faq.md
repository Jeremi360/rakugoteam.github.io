**Question:** So it's about adding a refined writing and dialogue system to the engine?

**Answer:** Yes, and kits and addons provide more:
nodes, objects and funcs to make easy to provide 
mechanics like in point&click, rpgs and etc.

**Q:** As a scenarist, what would I gain from using Rakugo over Ren'Py or Twine ?

**A:** It is made as godot addon - you can use all godot features.
You can make your game 2d, 2.5d or 3d - you can only 2d in Ren'Py.
You can easy add minigames or mix it with other game genre.
It will have mechanics for point&click games and rpgs - Ren'Py and Twine are only for vn.
This project's dialog functions can do more than Ren'Py equivalents.

**Q:** How does the project interact with the engine ?

**A:** For now this project is a singleton and a collection of special nodes.
There is included simple example how to connect this system to simple gui, 
if you want more advanced features, you can use one of provided Kits.

**Q:** What are the Kits ?

**A:** Kits are template for your game project.
They are Rakugo plus addons, and UI template
 that combines those together for given game genre.

**Q:** Is it easy to use ?

**A:** For now it is not that easy as I want it to be,
but we are working to make it use RakuScript
(this project's own language) similar to Ren'Py one.
