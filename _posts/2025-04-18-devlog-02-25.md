Hi everyone, welcome to **2st** devlog of **Rakugo Project** in year 2025.
This devlog is overdue as those releases are read for sometime,
but due to my poor financial situation, I have a slight depression,
which makes it hard for me to tackle trivial things like devlog.
So if you find my projects useful, please support project thought **[Patreon]**.
I really appreciate it and I will also be able to devote more time my projects, if you do so!

## AdvancedText

### New AdvancedTextLabel inspector

It hides `text` and `bbcode_enabled`,
this makes addon more secure to use
as this to shouldn't be changed manually.

### Markdown now works with both mode by default

Before you had to choose in between using `_` or `*` modes,
if was using Markdown parser, but now by default
you have new mode `both` so you can use any of both,
this means that, both versions works a the same time:
```markdown
_italics_ *italics*
__bold__ **bold**
- point in list
* point in list
```

### Button with **AdvancedTextLabel**

I removed **AdvancedTextButton**,
as now thanks to my other addon **Rakugo Nodes**,
is much easier configure button created using this nodes:
**AdvancedTextLabel**, **ButtonContainer** and **MarginContiner**
You also need to `mouse_filter` to `Ignore`
in both **MarginContiner** and **AdvancedTextLabel**.

[If you want me to crate **AdvancedTextButton** please make request.](https://github.com/rakugoteam/AdvancedText/issues)

### Hints 2.0

For me I never could make Godot's BBCode build-in `[hint]` markup to work,
also I knew that hint like this would be very simple,
as it would't support any markups and looks just like simple tooltip.

To fix that AdvancedText 3.0 introduces **Hints 2.0**.
We added simple to modify **HintPopup** singleton scene
*res://addons/advanced-text/HintPopup/hint_popup.tscn*

How have to define from where Hints should be taken
in **AdvancedTextLabel** by overriding `_hint_requested()` func.
In feature versions I will make it easier to use without out this requirement.

*This how it can looks implanted in game.*
