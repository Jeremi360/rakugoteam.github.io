Hi everyone, welcome to second devlog in year 2024,
it is **223h** devlog of **Rakugo Project**.
I'm happy to announce that we have new [**Emojis For Godot**] release.
We also crated **[online docs]** for [**Emojis For Godot**] addon.

I also have a great request that you consider the monetary support of the project trough
[Pateron] or [Itch.io], because I have recently had a big financial problems.

 - short aliases for emojis now are working again [#24]
 - faster reloading emojis [#26]
 - add documentation comments [#25]
 - add links and button to online docs [#25]
 - tested under godot 4.2 [#25]
