Hi everyone, welcome to **4st** devlog of **Rakugo Project** in year 2025.
This devlog is overdue, because my poor financial situation, I have a depression,
which makes it hard for me to work on Rakugo Projects or make trivial things like writing devlog.
So if you find my projects useful, please support financial project thought **[Patreon]**.
I really appreciate it, make less depressed and I will also be able to devote more time my projects!

## Some Progress on new features for RDS 2.3

- we have implemented `true` and `false` keywords [#283],
  but we still need to implement `not` keyword
- We now are working on implementing `await` keyword
- Working on using `Expression` for setting up var,
  checking conditions, using GDScript code in RkScripts

## Rakugo Port of _The Question_

![](images/devlog/the-question-port-0.8.png)

Port of _[The Question]_ is almost ready,
we need to make save/load working,
and maybe make theme the same as in original.

## Buy Me Some Time!

[Buy Me Some Time!] is game made using RDS.
_From game page_

> Game was build as part of the Klagenfurt Game Jam, Tech Editionâ€”a fun
> and fast-paced challenge where we had 48 hours to bring an idea to life.
> A simple Visual Novel with two small mini-games. All assets are hand-made.
> Let us know what you think, and thanks for checking it out!
>
> Your friend has committed a crime.
> The BASA Office of Investigation is looking for him.
> They came to you, hoping you would give them some information.

## Docs Progres

I finally started on updating docs in code and online.
**[AdvancedText]** docs in code are complete,
you can already [download update][AdvancedText] with docs in code.
Online version is almost ready, but first
I must crate docs for **Godot IconsFonts** and **RakugoNodes**.

_**See you soon in next devlog!**_
