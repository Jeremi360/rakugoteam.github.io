Hi everyone, welcome to **9th** devlog of **Rakugo Project** in year 2024.
If you find my projects useful, you can support the project via **[Patreon]**.
Thank you very much, if you decided to do!

## Incremental Releases and Updates

I recently realized that I was approaching Rakugo projects
and my other own projects come in a way that neither serves you.
Instead of staying under pressure to create their optimal version
with all the options I can think of, I switching into incremental releases/updates!

### What I understand as Incremental Releases/Updates
With this post I abandon this approach,
now I will try to release the minimum version of the project first,
then in subsequent updates I will add only a few new options and fixes.

You will soon see how it works as **Visual Novel Kit 2.0** will soon land here,
which is currently at the stage of implantation of the **Save/Load system**.
